Authentication and Middleware

For this lab, we will be creating a basic server with a user sign-up and user login. You will be storing a usernames and hashed password. In addition, we will be creating a very basic logging middleware.

We will be using two new npm packages for this lab:

bcrypt (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) : a password hasing library. If you have problems installing that modules (since it uses C++ bindings), you can also try bcrypt.js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) , which has the same API but is written in 100% JS. express-session (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) : a simple session middleware for Express.

Database Structure

You will use a database with the following structure:

The database will be called FirstName_LastName_lab10

The collection you use will be called users

A sample of the user schema as it will be stored in the database:

In this function you will hash the password using bcrypt. You will then insert the username and hashed password into the database.

If the insert was successful, your function will return: {userInserted: true} .

checkUser(username, password)

In this function, after you validate the inputs you will:

<ol>
<li>Query the db for the username supplied, if it is not found, throw an error stating ‚ÄúEither the username or password is invalid‚Äù.</li>
<li>If the username supplied is found in the DB, you will then use bcrypt to compare the hashed password in the database with the password input parameter.</li>
<li>If the passwords match your function will return {authenticated: true}</li>

GET /

The root route of the application will do one of two things:

<ol>
<li>If the user is authenticated, it will redirect to /private .</li>
<li>If the user is not authenticaed, it will render a view with a login form. The form will contain two inputs,
one for username and one for password. The form will be used to submit a POST request to the /login route on the server and must have an id of login-form . The input for the username must

have a name / id of username ; the input for the password must have name / id of password and should be an input type of password.
</li>
</ol>
You will also have a link on this page that links to /signup and has the text ‚ÄúNeed to register? Click here to sign-up‚Äù

Do not forget to use labels for your inputs!

An authenticated user should not ever see the login screen.

GET /signup

1. If the user is authenticated, it will redirect to /private .

explaining what they had entered incorrectly.

Making a POST request to this route you will call your createUser db function passing in

the username and password from the request.body .

If your database function returns {userInserted: true} you will then redirect the user to the / page so they can log in. If your DB function does not return this but also did not throw an error (perhaps the DB server was down when you tried to insert) you will respond with a status code of 500 and error message saying ‚ÄúInternal Server Error‚Äù

POST /login

You must do full input checking and error handling for the inputs in the routes.

1. You must make sure that username and password are supplied in the req.body

2. For username , it should be a valid string (no empty spaces, no spaces in the username and only

alphanumeric characters) and should be at least 4 characters long and should be case-insensitive. 3. For the password , it must be a valid string (no spaces, no empty spaces but can be any other

character including special characters) and should be at least 6 characters long.

If it fails the error checks or your DB function throws an error, you will render the login screen once again, and this time showing an error message (along with an HTTP 400 status code) to the user explaining what they had entered incorrectly.

This route is simple: making a POST to this route will attempt to log a user in with the credentials they provide in the login form.

You will call your checkUser db function passing in the username and password from the . If your DB function returns {authenticated: true} , You will have a cookie named (this is the name of the session in app.js). This cookie must be named AuthCookie or your assignment will receive a major point deduction. You will also store the username of the user in the session so you can display the value in the /private route. After logging in, you will redirect the user to the /private route.

If the user does not provide a valid login, you will render the login screen once again, and this time show an error message (along with an HTTP 400 status code) to the user explaining that they did not provide a valid username and/or password.

GET /private

This route will be simple, as well. This route will be protected your own authentication middleware to only

allow valid, logged in users to see this page.

If the user is logged in, you will make a simple view that displays the username (which you stored in the session when they logged in) for the currently logged in user.

GET /logout

This route will expire/delete the AuthCookie and inform the user that they have been logged out. It will

provide a URL hyperlink to the / route. Using express-session

This middleware package does one (fairly simple) thing. It creates a cookie for the browser that will be used to track the current session of the user, after we verify their login. We will expand on the

field to store information about the currently logged in user. You can see an example using

req.session here (https://github.com/expressjs/session#reqsession) . To initialize the middleware, you must do the following:

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
req.session

You can read more about session‚Äôs different configuration options here (https://github.com/expressjs/session#options) . For the sake of this lab, the above configuration is all you will need.

Authentication Middleware

This middleware will only be used for the GET /private route and will do one of the following:

1. If a user is not logged in, you will return an HTML page saying that the user is not logged in, and the page must issue an HTTP status code of 403 .

2. If the user is logged in, the middleware will ‚Äúfall through‚Äù to the next route calling the next() callback. See this reference (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) in the express

documentation to read more about middleware.

Logging Middleware

This middleware will log to your console for every request made to the server, with the following information:
